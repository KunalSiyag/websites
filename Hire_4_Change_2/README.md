## 📚 **Introduction** <a name="introduction"></a>

### 🎯 **Purpose** <a name="purpose"></a>
In India, providing employment opportunities to individuals residing in beggar shelters, widow houses, prisons, rehabilitation centers, orphanages, and similar institutions is challenging. These individuals often lack networking opportunities and face social stigma, unstable identity proof, and limited outreach. **Hire4Change** aims to bridge this gap by offering a freelancing platform that connects these marginalized individuals with potential employers, giving them a chance to showcase their skills and secure job opportunities.

### 🌍 **Project Scope** <a name="project-scope"></a>
**Hire4Change** will be a comprehensive web platform designed to:
- Allow both employers and employees to create and update their profiles.
- Automatically draft virtual contracts between employers, employees, and associated organizations.
- Include a feedback, review, and rating system, alongside an official complaint portal.
- Require a behavioral certificate for employees from their associated organizations to create profiles.
- Store and display employment history for all users on the platform.
